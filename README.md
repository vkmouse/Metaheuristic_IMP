### This code implements a greedy algorithm, four metaheuristic algorithms, and a improvement metaheuristic algorithm to solve the influence maximization problem (IMP) in the social network.
Four metaheuristic algorithms include simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), coral reefs optimization (CRO), and search economics (SE). An improvement metaheuristic algorithm is simulated annealing with search partition (SASP). And the greedy algorithm is hill climbing (HC). Two important algorithms are SE and SASP.

### Introduction
[Search economics (SE)](https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2015.447) is a novel metaheuristic algorithm proposed in 2015. The two main differences between SE and traditional metaheuristic are dividing the search space and investing computation resource depending on the potential of each subspace. The simulated results show that the [SEIM](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2018.08.033) is able to find a better solution than the HC, and SA. [SASP](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.306) is based on a search space partitioning machism to improve result of SA. Search space partition divides the solution space into many regions, and then search in the region or in all solution space in different period.
